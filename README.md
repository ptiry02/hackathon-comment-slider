# Comment slider

### This is my comment slider for the Barcelona Digital Talent Hackathon

<br>

I have started with _create-react-app_ using my own starting template you can find [here](https://github.com/ptiry02/my-cra-template).

<br>

- I used Reactjs because up until now I have only worked with this framework.

- For styling I use the _styled-components_ library; I think it makes the code cleaner because I can style directly inside the component without needing css files nor classes or IDs.

- For the carousel functionality I used a _react-bootstrap_ component which, in my opinion, is one of the easiest to implement and customize.

- Also, for this exercise, the content of the comment cards is in the constants.js file.
